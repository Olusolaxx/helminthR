I have read and agree to the the CRAN
policies at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

This is an update to the package to remove the ggmap dependency and provide a small bugfix to the cleanData function for removing species identified only to genus. I have also removed the ` symbols in place of ' symbols or code text in the documentation.


Thanks!
