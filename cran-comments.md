---

This is a new release. I have read and agree to the the CRAN
policies at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

URL added for database website. Examples are still labeled as `donttest`, as occasional hosting errors will throw invalid gateway errors, and the tests may take too long to complete.

Thanks!
