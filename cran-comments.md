I have read and agree to the the CRAN
policies at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

This is an update to the package, as a bug affecting 3 of the main functions
related to `location` string formation was causing trouble. I apologize for the
update so close to the new release. 

Thanks!
